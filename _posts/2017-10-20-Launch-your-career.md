The ORDINA BPS CAREER PATH defines several experience levels, from Associate to Master. Usually, companies only offer a training when you're a young graduate. We want to give potential and existing colleagues the chance to level up during their career. We therefore set up two EDUCATION PROGRAMMES that an Ordina BPS consultant can follow. One in the beginning of his or her career, and one for when someone already gained professional experience.
