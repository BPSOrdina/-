                            Migrations of different services towards the cloud is ongoing at a very high rate. Although cloud adoption is only happening faster, a lot of organizations still (partially) depend on their on-premises infrastructure.
                            <br /><br />In this track you will learn to master every aspect of a hybrid configuration. Identifying requirements, moving mailboxes, sites and unified messaging accounts between on-premises and the cloud, and managing both cloud- and on-premises infrastructure in one holistic approach.
                            <br /><br />Using the knowledge of on-premises product variants as a stepping stone, we gain deep insights into hybrid configuration of Exchange Server, Skype for Business Server and SharePoint Server.
                            <br /><br />Integrating all of the above, you will also get familiar with implementing and supporting a Microsoft Groups and Teams setup.
